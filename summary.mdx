## Guidelines & Limitations

I created my timeline based on the following goals and assumptions to guide my thought process.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Goals" icon="bullseye" iconType="regular">
    - Building long-term organic awareness and credibility
    - Focused on upper & middle funnelâ€”education about documentation, industry trends, Mintlify product education, use cases, diffrentiation
    - Balancing quick execution \+ long term infrastructure
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scope" icon="arrow-down-big-small">
    - Excluding initiatives that would be traditionally led by growth marketing & supported/distrubuted by content marketing (ie. referral programs, sponsored influencer/affiliate programs)
      - Focusing impact around owned, unpaid content (ie. socials, blog, email) as well as earned placements (ie. organic partnerships, editorials, and media)
      - In practice, would collaborate more closely with head of marketing, growth marketer, and technical writer on overlapping initiatives (not enough info to define at this stage)
    - Excluding retention-oriented strategies (ie. newsletters) to prioritize organic growth
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Target audience" icon="people">
    - Based on discussion with Tiffany, we're targeting both indie developers and enterprise teams
    - Target audience includes devs, dev team leads, technical writers, and PMs

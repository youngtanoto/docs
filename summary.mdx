## Assumptions

To get an idea of my thought process and considerations for this hypothetical assignment\! I may have decided to cover certain things and not others, and here is why:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Goals" icon="bullseye" iconType="regular">
    - Building long-term organic awareness, credibility, and community
    - Focused on upper & middle funnel, engagement/nurturing
    - Owned channels: Blog, newsletter, Linkedin/X, case studies, evergreen assets, co-marketing (unpaid), joint editorial, creators as co-writers/editors/guests), referral campaigns
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scope" icon="briefcase">
    - Balancing quick execution \+ long term structure
    - Excluding initiatives that would be traditionally led by growth marketing & supported/distrubuted by content
      - ie.  paid ads, referral programs, sponsored influencer/affiliate programs) â€” definitely possible crossovers in a startup environment, but just to make this assignment more straightforward since division of responsibilities hasn't been discussed
    - Excluding retention-oriented strategies like newsletters, focusing on organic growth
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Target audience" icon="people">
    Devs, Technical Writers, PMs (for indie \+ enterprise)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

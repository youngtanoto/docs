## Defining Assumptions

To get an idea of my thought process and considerations for this hypothetical assignment\! I may have decided to cover certain things and not others, and here is why:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Goals" icon="bullseye" iconType="regular">
    - Building long-term organic awareness, credibility, and community
    - Focused on upper & middle funnel — education about documentation best practices/value, industry trends, product education, use cases, diffrentiation
    - Balancing quick execution \+ long term infrastructure  
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scope" icon="briefcase">
    - Excluding initiatives that would be traditionally led by growth marketing & supported/distrubuted by content marketing (ie. referral programs, sponsored influencer/affiliate programs)
      - Focusing impact around owned content like socials, blog, email, organic partnerships; likely supporting/sharing certain responsibilities with technical writer, head of marketing, and growth marketer (TBD—possible there will be more collaboration, but just assuming for the purpose of making this assignment more straightforward and concrete)
    - Excluding retention-oriented strategies like newsletters, focusing on organic growth
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Target audience" icon="people">
    - Devs, Technical Writers, PMs (for indie \+ enterprise)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

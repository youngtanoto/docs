## Defining Assumptions

You may notice I decided to cover certain things (and not others)\! Read if you're curious about my thought process and considerations for this hypothetical assignment. 

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Goals" icon="bullseye" iconType="regular">
    - Building long-term organic awareness, credibility, and community
    - Focused on upper & middle funnel — education about documentation best practices/value, industry trends, product education, use cases, diffrentiation
    - Balancing quick execution \+ long term infrastructure
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scope" icon="arrow-down-big-small">
    - Excluding initiatives that would be traditionally led by growth marketing & supported/distrubuted by content marketing (ie. referral programs, sponsored influencer/affiliate programs)
      - Focusing impact around owned content like socials, blog, email, organic partnerships; likely supporting/sharing certain responsibilities with technical writer, head of marketing, and growth marketer (TBD—probable there will be more collaboration/hats, but just assuming for the purpose of making this assignment more straightforward and concrete)
    - Excluding retention-oriented strategies like newsletters, focusing on organic growth
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Target audience" icon="people">
    - Devs, Technical Writers, PMs (for indie \+ enterprise)

## Defining Assumptions

You may notice I decided to cover certain things (and not others). Read if you're curious about my thought process for this hypothetical.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Goals" icon="bullseye" iconType="regular">
    - Building long-term organic awareness, credibility, and community
    - Focused on upper & middle funnelâ€”education about documentation, industry trends, Mintlify product education, use cases, diffrentiation
    - Balancing quick execution \+ long term infrastructure
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scope" icon="arrow-down-big-small">
    - Excluding initiatives that would be traditionally led by growth marketing & supported/distrubuted by content marketing (ie. referral programs, sponsored influencer/affiliate programs)
      - Focusing impact around owned, unpaid content like socials, blog, email, organic partnerships
      - In practice, would collaborate closely with technical writer, head of marketing, and growth marketer on overlapping initiatives (TBD)
    - Excluding retention-oriented strategies like newsletters to prioritize organic growth
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Target audience" icon="people">
    - Devs, Technical Writers, PMs (for indie \+ enterprise)
  </Accordion>
